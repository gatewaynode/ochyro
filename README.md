**Entymology: (Greek), "fortress, stronghold, redoubt, block house"**

A Content Management System that emphasizes security and ease of use.  Written in Python 3 built on Flask, Flask Migrate, Flask Freeze and SQL Alchemy.  Primarily designed to build statically hosted web pages.

Really just barely functioning right now.  I don't recommend using it yet.  Much to come.
